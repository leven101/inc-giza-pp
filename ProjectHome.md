Incremental word alignments for SMT using online EM.
Currently supports IBM Model 1 and HMM-based word
alignments.

Supports disk-based incremental alignments (main.cpp.org / Makefile.org)
or server/client calls via XMLRPC (main.cpp.xmlrpc / Makefile.xmlrpc).
See the toy/ folder for example configuration files for
both disk-based and RPC style updates.
